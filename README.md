# Keyword in C++

bool: Represents Boolean values, either true or false.

char: Represents a single character, such as 'a' or '5'.

double: Represents double-precision floating-point numbers.

enum: Defines a user-defined enumeration with named values.

float: Represents single-precision floating-point numbers.

int: Represents integers (whole numbers without decimal points).

long: Represents integers with a larger range than int.

short: Represents short integers with a smaller range than int.

unsigned: Modifies integer types to represent only non-negative values (zero and positive).

void: Represents the absence of type. Used in functions that do not return a value.

auto: Infers the data type of a variable automatically by the compiler.

const: Specifies that a variable's value cannot be changed after initialization.

mutable: Specifies that a member of a class can be modified even if the containing object is const.

dynamic_cast, const_cast, reinterpret_cast, static_cast: Used for type casting in C++. Each serves a specific purpose like converting between types.

sizeof: Returns the size, in bytes, of a data type or an object.

typedef: Allows the creation of aliases for data types.

typename: Used in template programming to declare a dependent type name.

namespace: Defines a scope to avoid naming conflicts.

new, delete: Dynamically allocate and deallocate memory on the heap.

operator: Defines custom operators or overloads existing ones.

template: Used for generic programming, allowing code to work with different data types.

try, catch, throw: Used for exception handling in C++.

if, else, switch, case, default: Control flow statements for conditional execution.

while, do, for: Looping constructs for repetitive execution.

break, continue: Used in loops to control the flow of execution.

return: Ends the execution of a function and returns a value.

class, struct: Define user-defined types with data members and member functions.

public, private, protected: Specify access control for class members.

friend: Grants non-member functions access to private and protected members of a class.

const_cast: Allows removal of the const qualifier from a variable.

volatile: Indicates that a variable may be changed by external factors, preventing certain optimizations by the compiler.

register: Suggests to the compiler to store a variable in a register for faster access.

false, true: Boolean literals representing logical values.

goto: Control transfer statement, generally discouraged in modern programming due to its potential for creating complex and hard-to-follow code.
